_From the report, motivation_: The questionnaire for the Global Party Survey was administered through the Qualtrics platform. It includes 21 core items measured using ten-point continuous scales. These were designed to identify each party’s current ideological values, their position on several issues such as immigration, nationalism and environmental protection, and their use of populist rhetoric.
